# tsh-rs

A Rust implementation of Tiny Shell (tsh) - a remote shell access tool for secure command execution and file transfers.

## Features

- **Secure Communication**: Noise Protocol with ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encryption
- **Cross-platform**: Supports Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Multiple Operation Modes**:
  - Interactive shell access
  - File download (`get`)
  - File upload (`put`)
  - Direct command execution
- **Connection Modes**:
  - Direct connection to server
  - Connect-back mode (server connects to client)
- **Modern Rust Implementation**: 
  - Memory safety
  - Async/await with Tokio
  - Strong error handling
  - Zero-cost abstractions

## Components

- **`tsh`** - Client application for connecting to remote systems
- **`tshd`** - Server daemon that provides shell access

## Building

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install cross-compilation targets (optional)
make install-targets
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build Linux x64 binaries
make linux

make windows

# Build macOS binaries (both x64 and ARM64)
make macos

# Build for custom target
make unix TARGET=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Development build
make dev

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

See `make help` for all available commands.

## Usage

### Server (tshd)

```bash
# Listen mode - wait for connections on port 1234
./tshd -p 1234

# Connect-back mode - connect to client every 5 seconds
./tshd -c 192.168.1.100 -p 1234 -d 5
```

### Client (tsh)

```bash
# Interactive shell
./tsh -p 1234 192.168.1.100

# Connect-back mode (wait for server)
./tsh -p 1234 cb

# Download file
./tsh 192.168.1.100 get:/remote/file.txt:./local/

# Upload file  
./tsh 192.168.1.100 put:./local/file.txt:/remote/

# Execute command
./tsh 192.168.1.100 "ls -la"
```

## Command Line Options

### tsh (Client)
- `-p, --port <PORT>` - Port number (default: 1234)
- `<HOST>` - Target hostname or "cb" for connect-back mode
- `[ACTION]` - Action to perform (get:remote:local, put:local:remote, or command)

### tshd (Server)
- `-p, --port <PORT>` - Port number (default: 1234)
- `-c, --connect-back <HOST>` - Connect back to host (client mode)
- `-d, --delay <SECONDS>` - Connect back delay in seconds (default: 5)

## Security Features

- **Noise Protocol Framework**: Modern cryptographic protocol with proven security
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD**: Authenticated encryption with associated data
- **X25519 Key Exchange**: Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement
- **BLAKE2s Hashing**: Fast and secure cryptographic hash function
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each session uses ephemeral keys
- **Quantum Resistance**: X25519 provides resistance to quantum attacks on key exchange

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Noise Protocol Layer**: Modern encrypted communication using Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s
- **PTY Abstraction**: Cross-platform pseudo-terminal interface  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with context
- **Async I/O**: Built on Tokio for high performance

### Security Design

1. **Key Exchange**: X25519 elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
2. **Handshake**: Noise XX pattern with mutual authentication
3. **Encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD for confidentiality and integrity
4. **Hashing**: BLAKE2s for fast cryptographic operations
5. **Message Framing**: Length-prefixed encrypted messages with authentication

## Improvements over Go Version

- **Memory Safety**: Rust prevents buffer overflows and memory corruption
- **Async Performance**: Tokio provides efficient async I/O
- **Error Handling**: Result types force explicit error handling
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents many runtime errors
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level features with no runtime overhead
- **Better Tooling**: Cargo provides excellent dependency management
