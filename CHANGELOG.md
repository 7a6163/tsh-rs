## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-08

**Evasion, Reconnaissance & Pivoting**

### ✨ Added
- **Jitter**: Connect-back delay randomized ±25% to defeat EDR beaconing detection
- **System info collection**: Agent reports hostname, OS, arch, user, privileges on connect (`sysinfo` action)
- **Persistence**: Auto-start on reboot via LaunchAgent (macOS), systemd user service (Linux), Registry Run key (Windows). Install with `--install`, remove with `--uninstall`
- **SOCKS5 proxy**: Pivot into internal networks through the agent (`socks5` action). Each SOCKS5 connection gets its own encrypted Noise session
- **C2 over WebSocket**: New `--transport https` flag routes all traffic through WebSocket frames, blending with normal HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- **Config file support**: `--config` flag loads PSK and connection settings from a JSON file (used by persistence)

### 🏗️ Changed
- **NoiseLayer abstracted**: `stream` field changed from `TcpStream` to `Box<dyn AsyncStream>`, enabling any async transport (TCP, WebSocket, etc.)
- `--psk` is no longer required when using `--config` or `--uninstall`
- `handle_client_connection` is now public for use by alternative transports

### 🧪 Tests
- Added 39 new tests (111 → 150 total)
  - `jitter_tests` (7): Boundary values, range validation, distribution
  - `sysinfo_tests` (8): Collection, JSON round-trip, display formatting
  - `persistence_tests` (8): Config serialization, load/save, error cases
  - `socks5_tests` (13): TargetAddr wire format, round-trip, error handling
  - `c2_https_tests` (3): WsByteStream adapter with echo, multiple messages, large payloads

### 📦 Dependencies
- Added `tokio-tungstenite` 0.24 (WebSocket transport)
- Added `futures-util` 0.3 (async stream utilities)

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-13

### 🔐 Security
- **Critical fix**: Updated `slab` dependency from 0.4.10 to 0.4.11 to fix RUSTSEC-2025-0047
  - Fixed out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in `get_disjoint_mut`
  - Prevents potential undefined behavior and crashes

### 🔧 Maintenance
- Updated all dependencies to latest compatible versions
- Code quality improvements in terminal module

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-28

**🛠️ Critical Fixes & Code Quality Improvements**

### 🔧 Fixed
- **Signal handling**: Fixed Ctrl+C not working in server mode - now gracefully shuts down
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Fixed Windows test failures with proper temp directory handling
- **Cross-platform commands**: Fixed shell command execution on Windows vs Unix systems
- **Memory safety**: Removed all dead code and unused dependencies for cleaner codebase

### 🗑️ Removed
- All unused `authenticate_with_psk` functions (redundant with Noise Protocol integration)
- Unused fields in PTY structure (`writer` field)
- Entire legacy `pel.rs` module (Packet Encryption Layer)
- Unused cryptographic dependencies: `aes`, `cbc`, `hmac`, `sha1`
- All remaining `tshd` references from documentation and GitHub workflows

### 🏗️ Improved
- **Signal handling**: Integrated signal handlers directly into main event loop using `tokio::select!`
- **Test reliability**: Cross-platform test suite now passes on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Documentation**: Updated all references to reflect unified binary architecture
- **Security documentation**: Updated cryptographic details to reflect Noise Protocol implementation
- **Code formatting**: Applied consistent formatting across entire codebase

### 🔐 Security
- **Fixed vulnerability**: Updated `slab` dependency from 0.4.10 to 0.4.11 (RUSTSEC-2025-0047)
- Enhanced server shutdown process (graceful vs forced exit)
- Improved error handling in network connections
- Added security hardening flags via `.cargo/config.toml`

### ✨ Enhanced
- **Interactive shell improvements**: Added command history, line editing, and cursor navigation
- Terminal handling with colored prompts and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+L, arrow keys)
- Better user experience with 1000-command history and in-line editing capabilities

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-28

**🏗️ Architecture Consolidation & Security Hardening**

### 🔧 Added
- Single unified binary architecture (`tsh` with `server`/`client` subcommands)
- Security hardening compilation flags (PIE, RELRO, stack protection)
- Cross-platform test compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Comprehensive documentation updates
- Pre-shared key (PSK) authentication with challenge-response

### 🗑️ Removed
- Separate `tshd` binary (consolidated into `tsh server`)
- Dead code cleanup (unused authentication functions, PTY fields)
- Removed legacy dependencies (aes, cbc, hmac, sha1)
- Removed entire PEL (Packet Encryption Layer) module

### 🔧 Changed
- **BREAKING**: Command line interface now uses subcommands
  - Old: `tshd -p 1234` → New: `tsh server --psk key --port 1234`
  - Old: `tsh -p 1234 host` → New: `tsh client --psk key host:1234`
- Enhanced security configuration via `.cargo/config.toml`
- Updated all documentation and GitHub templates
- Improved error messages and cross-platform compatibility

### 🔒 Security
- Added compilation security hardening flags
- Improved binary security analysis results
- Enhanced PSK-based authentication over encrypted channel
- Removed potential attack surface by consolidating binaries

### 🐛 Fixed
- Windows compatibility issues in integration tests
- Cross-platform shell command execution
- Temporary file handling across different operating systems
- All clippy warnings and formatting issues
