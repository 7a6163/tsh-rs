## üêõ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security reports to: [your-security-email@domain.com]
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

## üîç Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Use Strong Secrets**: Never use default passwords in production
   ```bash
   # Good
   ./tsh -s "MySecurePassword123!" -p 8080 target
   
   # Bad
   ./tsh -s "1234" -p 8080 target
   ```

2. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and VPNs when possible
   ```bash
   # Bind to specific interface
   ./tsh server --psk "MySecureKey123!" --port 8080
   ```

3. **Monitor Connections**: Log and monitor all connections
   ```bash
   # Enable verbose logging
   RUST_LOG=info ./tsh server --psk "MySecureKey123!" --port 8080
   ```

4. **Regular Updates**: Keep tsh-rs updated to the latest version

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require review
2. **Static Analysis**: Use cargo clippy and cargo audit
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies
4. **Testing**: Include security test cases

## üîê Cryptographic Details

### Encryption Implementation
- **Protocol**: Noise Protocol Framework (Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2s)
